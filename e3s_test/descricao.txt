1) Develop a command-line or GUI program that splits an input image in the
   3 RGB channels, generating 3 new images and displaying them (if a GUI application). 

2) Expand the same program to apply a Blur filter into the input image (each pixel
   in the target image is obtained by the average of all the pixels surrounding it,
   including itself);

3) Expand the Blur algorithm to receive two parameters: neighbor level (how many
   neighbors should be taken; level 1 is the basic blur, where each pixel surrounding
   the central pixel is taking in account, a square of 8 pixels; level 2 means that
   the square has size 5, 2 pixels at each side of the central one, 24 pixels) and
   central pixel weight, making a weighted average instead of a simple average.
